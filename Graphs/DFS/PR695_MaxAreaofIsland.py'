    """
    Depth-First Search (DFS) helper function.

    This function explores an island starting from cell (i, j).
    It marks visited land cells as 0 to avoid revisiting and
    recursively explores all four directions (up, down, left, right).

    Parameters:
        grid (List[List[int]]): 2D grid of 0s (water) and 1s (land).
        i (int): Row index of the current cell.
        j (int): Column index of the current cell.

    Returns:
        int: The area (number of cells) of the island connected to (i, j).

    Diagram (DFS exploration):
        Suppose we start at (i, j) marked as 'X':

            [1][1][0][0]
            [1][X][0][1]
            [0][1][1][1]
            [0][0][0][1]

        DFS will:
        - Count the current cell
        - Move Up, Down, Left, Right
        - Continue until all connected '1's are visited
        - Return the total area of this island

class Solution:
    """
    Solution class for the 'Max Area of Island' problem.

    Problem:
        Given a 2D grid of 0s (water) and 1s (land),
        find the largest island (connected group of 1s).
        An island is connected horizontally or vertically.

    Approach:
        - Iterate through each cell in the grid.
        - When a land cell (1) is found, run DFS to compute its area.
        - Track the maximum area encountered.
        - Return the maximum island area.

    Example:
        Input:
            grid = [
                [0,0,1,0],
                [1,1,1,0],

                [1,0,0,0]
            ]

        Output:
            5  (largest island has 5 connected land cells)
