    """
    A class to implement the strStr() function, which finds the starting index 
    of the first occurrence of a substring (needle) inside another string (haystack).

    Problem:
    - Given two strings: haystack and needle.
    - Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack.
    - If needle is not found, return -1.

    Approach:
    - Use a simple sliding window technique.
    - First, check if the needle exists in the haystack at all.
    - If not, return -1 immediately.
    - If it exists, iterate through haystack character by character.
    - At each position, compare the substring of haystack (of length equal to needle)
      with the needle.
    - If they match, return the current index.

    def strStr(self, haystack, needle):
        # Pointer to track current index in haystack
        r = 0

        # Quick check: if needle is not present at all, return -1
        if needle not in haystack:
            return -1

        # Iterate through haystack
        while r < len(haystack):
            # Check if the current character matches the first character of needle
            if haystack[r] == needle[0]:
                # Compare substring of haystack with needle
                if haystack[r:r + len(needle)] == needle:
                    return r  # Found the starting index
            r += 1  # Move to the next character

        # If no match found, return -1 (though this case is already handled above)
        return -1
